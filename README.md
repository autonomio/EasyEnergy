# EasyEnergy


Track the energy consumption for your machine learning experiments.


EasyEnergy helps in the goal of energy tracking and reduction of carbon footprint in your machine learning experiments.

### :wrench: Key Features

1) Callbacks

Energy tracking can be done during model training and model inference with the help of simple Callbacks which can be added to your custom machine learning experiment.

2) Machine Energy Tracking

Given a list of machines, this feature helps track the machine with the least energy consumption and carbon emission.
